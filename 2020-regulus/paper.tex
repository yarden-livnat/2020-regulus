%% Uncomment one of the lines above depending on where your paper is
%% in the conference process. ``review'' and ``widereview'' are for review
%% submission, ``preprint'' is for pre-publication, and the final version
%% doesn't use a specific qualifier.

%% Please use one of the ``review'' options in combination with the
%% assigned online id (see below) ONLY if your paper uses a double blind
%% review process. Some conferences, like IEEE Vis and InfoVis, have NOT
%% in the past.

%% Please use the ``preprint''  option when producing a preprint version
%% for sharing your article on an open access repository

%% Please note that the use of figures other than the optional teaser is not permitted on the first page
%% of the journal version.  Figures should begin on the second page and be
%% in CMYK or Grey scale format, otherwise, colour shifting may occur
%% during the printing process.  Papers submitted with figures other than the optional teaser on the
%% first page will be refused. Also, the teaser figure should only have the
%% width of the abstract as the template enforces it.

%% These few lines make a distinction between latex and pdflatex calls and they

%% Note that due to the \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{} call it is no longer necessary
%% to provide the the path and extension of a graphics file:
%% \includegraphics{diamondrule} is completely sufficient.

  \caption{A \RT provides a concise annotated overview of all Morse-Smale complex partitions for the entire persistence hierarchy. In a study of temperature as a function of chemical species, the \RT on the left encodes Child Dimension Fitness that highlights partitions with different characteristics than their parents (red/blue indicate small/large differences).  Selection of the top partitions shows a single maximum and four distinct minima in the graph view (middle). Projections of the data points in the four partitions (right) demonstrates that two unique minima are due to lack of fuel (top) and lack of oxidizer (bottom), while the other two identify  unmixed fuel and oxidizer due to turbulence in the combustion reaction. }
