	Abstract = {Many algorithms for scientific visualization and image analysis are
rooted in the world of continuous scalar, vector, and tensor fields,
but are programmed in low-level languages and libraries that obscure
their mathematical foundations.  Diderot is a parallel domain-specific
language that is designed to bridge this semantic gap by providing the
programmer with a high-level, mathematical programming notation that
allows direct expression of mathematical concepts in code.
Furthermore, Diderot provides parallel performance that takes
advantage of modern multicore processors and GPUs. The high-level
notation allows a concise and natural expression of the algorithms and
the parallelism allows efficient execution on real-world datasets.},
