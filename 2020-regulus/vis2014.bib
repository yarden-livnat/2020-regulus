If the topographical function is itself a distance function, then the topographical distance becomes identical with the geodesic distance function and the watershed becomes identical with the skeleton by zone of influence. The classical shortest paths algorithms of the graph theory are then revisited in order to derive new watershed algorithms, which are either new or more easy to implement in hardware."

Further, a remarkable insensitivity of the pdf is observed with respect to the Reynolds number and the choice of the scalar.}

  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel combinatorial algorithm to compute a
              hierarchy of discrete gradient vector fields for three-dimensional
              scalar fields. The hierarchy is defined by an importance measure
              and represents the combinatorial gradient flow for different levels
              of detail. The presented algorithm is based on Forman's discrete
              Morse theory, which guarantees topological consistency and algorithmic
              robustness. In contrast to previous work, our algorithm combines
              memory and runtime efficiency. It thereby lends itself to the analysis
              of large data sets. A discrete gradient vector field is also a compact
              representation of the underlying extremal structures - the critical
              points, separation lines and surfaces. Given a certain level of detail,
              an explicit geometric representation of these structures can be extracted
              using simple and fast graph algorithms.},
