How to show the set of extrema points at a persistence level along side the TreeView?
	what about a non-uniform refinement?

Look for previous work on Morse-Smale 
\begin{enumerate}
\item local refinement rather than a global persistence level
\begin{enumerate}
\item based on local properties 
\item based on relations to other nodes in the tree (parent/child)
\end{enumerate}
\item  using MS for partitions analysis (any work other than Gerber, Dan?)

\end{enumerate}
